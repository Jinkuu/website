# Sample Website

This is a sample website made as part of [*Learn Enoughâ„¢ Git to Be
Dangerous*](http://learnenough.com/git-tutorial). I'm learning a lot from it and I honestly think it's one of the better resources out there for learning Git. 

For more information on Git, see the
[official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/).
